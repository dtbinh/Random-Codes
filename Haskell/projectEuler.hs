 - Problem 1
 -
 - Multiples of 3 and 5
 -
 - If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get
 - 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
 - 
 - Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

{-
 - Problem 2
 -
 - Even Fibonacci numbers
 -
 - Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous
 - two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
 -              1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
 - By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed
 - four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
